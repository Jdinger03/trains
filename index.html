	<h1 id="history">History</h1>
	<p>The Sydney Light Rail is a light rail system serving Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It opened in August 1997 as the Sydney Monorail, a single-line monorail system in the central business district. The monorail closed in June 2013, and its infrastructure was demolished to make way for the new light rail system.</p>
	<h1 id="construction">Construction</h1>
	<p>The construction of the light rail network began in October 2015, and the first line, the CBD and South East Light Rail, opened in December 2019. The line runs from Circular Quay in the central business district to Kingsford and Randwick in the south-eastern suburbs of Sydney. The line is 12 kilometers long and has 19 stops.</p>

	<p>The rolling stock used on the Sydney Light Rail network consists of 60 Alstom Citadis X05 trams. The trams are 33 meters long and can carry up to 450 passengers each. They are equipped with air conditioning, low floors, and wide doors for easy boarding and alighting. The trams also have an onboard energy storage system that allows them to run without overhead wires in some sections of the network.</p>
